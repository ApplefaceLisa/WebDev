### Introduction to Node.js and NPM
(Week01_1-Nodejs.pdf)

- What is Node.js
  - Javascript runtime built on Chrome V8 Javascript engine
  - Uses an event-driven, non-bloking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient.
  
- Node Architecture

- Node.js use cases
  - Utilities written in JavaScript for web development (Bower, Grunt, Gulp, Yeoman, etc.)
  - Server-Side Development (Web server, Business logic, Database access)
  
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
  - NPM manages ecosystem of node modules / packages
  - A package contains: JS files and package.json (manifest)
  
- Setting up Node.js and npm on your computer  
  - Verifying the Node Installation: `node -v`, `npm -v`
  
- Additional resources
  - [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [Npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  - [Node API Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/)
  - [NPM Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/)

### Node Modules
- Objectives
  - Write simple Node applications and run them using Node
  - Develop Node modules and use them within your Node applications
  - Learn about using callbacks and handling errors within your Node application
  
- Node Modules
  - Each file in Node is its own module
  - The _module_ variable gives access to the current module definition in a file
  - The _module.exports_ variable determines the export from the current module
  - The _require_ function is used to import a module into Node application
  
- Callbacks and Error handling
  - two salient features of JavaScript for supporting callbacks
    - First-class functions : A function can be treated the same way as any other variable
    - Closures: 
      - A function defined inside another function has access to all the variables declared in the outer function (outer scope).
      - The inner function will continue to have access to the variables from the outer scope even after the outer function has returned.

### Node and HTTP
