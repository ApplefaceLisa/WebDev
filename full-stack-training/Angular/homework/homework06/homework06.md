# Question description
Start with a good example at W3Schooles.com:

http://www.w3schools.com/angular/tryit.asp?filename=try_ng_w3css

It shows a list of users (which is in a JS array) and allows NEW / EDIT on a selected user.

This homework is to enhance this app in the following way:  
1. Add a few new fields such as Title, Sex, Age. It should be to all aspects, including list, new, and
edit;  
2. Implement filtering / searching and sorting to the User list.  
3. Implement 'Delete User' - add a new column in the User list. In this column, each rows shows a 'delete' icon. By clicking it, the selected user will be deleted from the list (and the JS array).  
4. Implement paging / pagination by having 'Prev Page' and 'Next Page'. (the size of each page is pre-defined, such as 20).

Note: You should create your own code files for this.
