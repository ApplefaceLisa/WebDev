## 1. MVC
- Model View Controller or MVC is a software design pattern for developing web applications. A Model View Controller pattern is made up of the following three parts
  - Model − It is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.
  - View − It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
  - Controller − It is a software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View.

- The _**Model**_ is responsible for managing application data. It responds to the request from view and to the instructions from controller to update itself.
- The _**View**_ is a presentation of data in a particular format, triggered by the controller's decision to present the data. They are script-based template systems such as JSP, ASP, PHP and very easy to integrate with AJAX technology.
- The _**Controller**_ responds to user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives input, validates it, and then performs business operations that modify the state of the data model.

AngularJS is a MVC based framework.
