# Build a Simon Game

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE.

- Fulfill the below _*user stories*_. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
  - I am presented with a random series of button presses.
  - Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
  - I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
  - If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
  - I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
  - If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
  - I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
  - I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

- Hint: 

  Here are mp3s you can use for each button:

- [Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval](http://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval)
  - _**Recursive setTimeout guarantees a delay between the executions, setInterval â€“ does not.**_
  ```javascript
    let i = 1;
    setTimeout(function run() {
      func(i);
      setTimeout(run, 100);
    }, 100);
  ```
