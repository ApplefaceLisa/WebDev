# Show the Local Weather

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

- Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- User Story: 
  - I can see the weather in my current location.
  - I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
  - I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

- We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.

- Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

- When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

- You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
