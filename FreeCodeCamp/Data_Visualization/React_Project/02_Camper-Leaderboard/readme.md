# FCC Build a Camper Leaderboard
### [requirment](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard)
#### User Story
- I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
- I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
- I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

- [reference website](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/)

#### Hint
- To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.
- To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.
