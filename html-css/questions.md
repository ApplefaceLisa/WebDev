- What is <!DOCTYPE> used for in HTML?

  The <!DOCTYPE> declaration tells the browser what version of (X)HTML is being used so it will know how to display the page. The declaration may also provide a link to a text file (i.e., the loose DTD) which the browser uses to obtain further information.
  
- What can be specified using <meta> HTML element?

  Metadata is data (information) about data.

  The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.

  Meta elements are typically used to specify _**page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata**_.

  The metadata can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services.

  HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).
