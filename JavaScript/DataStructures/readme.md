# Data Structures & Algorithms with JavaScript

- ## Arrays and Lists: the most common data structures

- ## Stacks and Queues: more complex list-like data structures

- ## Linked lists: how they overcome the shortcomings of arrays

- ## Dictionaries: storing data as key-value pairs

- ## Hashing: good for quick insertion and retrieval

- ## Sets: useful for storing unique elements that appear only once

- ## Binary Trees: storing data in a hierarchy manner

- ## Graphs and graph algorithms: ideal for modeling networks

- ## Algorithms: including those that help you sort or search data

- ## Advanced algorithms: dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
