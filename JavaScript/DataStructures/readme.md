# Data Structures & Algorithms with JavaScript

- ## Arrays and Lists: the most common data structures
  ### Array
  - native to Javascript
  
  ### List
  

- ## Stacks and Queues: more complex list-like data structures
   ### Stack
   - used throughout computer science in both _**compiler and operating system implementations**_.
  
  
  ### Queue
  - Queues are used extensively in simulation software where data has to be _**lined up**_ before it is processed.

- ## Linked lists: how they overcome the shortcomings of arrays
  - A linked list is a modification of the list data structure, where each element is a separate object linked to the objects on either side of it.
  - Linked lists are efficient when you need to perform _**multiple insertions and deletions**_ in your program.

- ## Dictionaries: storing data as key-value pairs
  - store data as key-value pairs.

- ## Hashing: good for quick insertion and retrieval

  ### Hash Table
  - One way to implement a dictionary is to use a hash table.
  - how to build hash tables and the hash algorithms that are used to store data in the table.

- ## Sets: useful for storing unique elements that appear only once
  - Sets are useful for storing data that is not supposed to have duplicates in the data set.

- ## Binary Trees: storing data in a hierarchy manner
  ### Binary Trees
  
  
  ### Binary Search Trees
  - binary search trees are useful for storing data that needs to be stored originally in sorted form.

- ## Graphs and graph algorithms: ideal for modeling networks
  - Graphs are used to represent data such as the _**nodes of a computer network or the cities on a map**_.

- ## Algorithms: including those that help you sort or search data
  ### Sorting
  
  ### Searching

- ## Advanced algorithms: dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
  ### dynamic programming 
  
  ### greedy algorithms
